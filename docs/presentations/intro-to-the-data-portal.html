# Who am I?

- Developer, Tinkerer, avid dog lover
![jessie](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B8jz4H_jWoSQdGJ0YW1naktiZDA)

---

# What is a data portal?
- Single access for a wide variety of datasets
- Provides some set of APIs around querying and manipulating the dataset
- Some degree of user management

---

# Inspirations

- [The DC Data Portal](data.dc.gov)
- The original open data dc data portal
- [Open Data Philly](https://www.opendataphilly.org/)
- [Western Pennsylvania Data Portal](https://www.wprdc.org/)

---

# What is CKAN?

### From the source:

> CKAN is a powerful data management system that makes data accessible â€“
by providing tools to streamline publishing, sharing, finding and using data. 
CKAN is aimed at data publishers (national and regional governments, companies and 
organizations) wanting to make their data open and available.

[CKAN](https://ckan.org/)

---

# What did we do to it?

- Plugins, plugins and more plugins
- A little bit on window dressing

---

# Walkthroughs

1. Making a data request
2. Creating a dataset
3. Previewing a dataset
4. Querying a dataset

---

# CKAN API

- Lots and lots of functionality to explore
- Shortlist:
  - Programatically creating and updating datasets
  - Joining multiple datasets
  - Adding large files
  - Importing/exporting data
- [Documentation](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/)
