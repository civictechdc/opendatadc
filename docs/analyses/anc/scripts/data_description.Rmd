#### Terms:

Ward - division of the district, 1-8

ANC - Advisory Neighborhood Commission. Subdivision of ward identified by letter, e.g. 5D. Around 5-10 commissioners serve on an ANC.

SMD - "Single-member district"; subdivision of ANC from which a single ANC commissioner is elected


#### Format for cleaned_data filenames:

<year(s)>\_\<content>\_\<aggregation level>.csv

e.g.

2018_ancElection_commissioners_contest.csv is data from 2018 comprising both ANC Elections and subsequently incumbent commissioners, aggregated at the contest level


#### Pipeline

Commands to run the data processing steps are given in ./Makefile  

To make a given target, run 'make \<target\>' (with filepaths relative to the directory holding the Makefile)  
e.g. to create 2012_2018_ancElection_contest.csv, run 'make cleaned_data/2012_2018_ancElection_contest.csv'  

To create all processed data, run 'make process'


### 2012-2018 Election, contest-level



```{r, echo=FALSE}

f("../cleaned_data/2012_2018_ancElection_contest.csv")

```
- contest_name - ANC identifier

- ward_ballots - ignore
- over_votes - number of ballots not counted due to multiple votes for ANC commissioner
- under_votes - number of ballots with no vote for ANC comm.
- ward_anc_votes - ignore

### 2012-2018 Elections, candidate-level

```{r, echo=FALSE}

f("../cleaned_data/2012_2018_ancElection_candidate.csv")

```


### 2012-2018 Elections, ANC-level

```{r, echo=FALSE}

f("../cleaned_data/2012_2018_ancElection_anc.csv")

```

- ward, year, anc -- as above
- num_candidates -- average number of registered candidates
- votes - average number of votes for winning candidates in ANC
- vote_norm - average of ratio between winner votes and ballots cast (not total ANC votes)
- engagement - average of ratio between total ANC votes and ballots cast






### 2012-2018 imputed turnout, ANC-level

```{r, echo=FALSE}

f("../cleaned_data/2012_2018_imputedTurnout_anc.csv")

```

produced by impute_turnout.R by taking _ballots_precinct.csv and apportioning precinct-level ballot and registration counts among ANCs based on geographic overlap.  

- voters -- imputed registered voters in ANC
- ballots -- imputed ballots cast in ANC
- duplicitous -- number of precincts which cross this ANCs boundary
- turnout -- ballots / voters  

Turnout data without imputation is available by uncommenting the line that saves 'reg.fixed.drop' in impute_turnout.R; however this data drops something like half of precincts.  

For some evaluation of the imputed data, run 'make visualization/imputed_turnout.html'  




### 2012-2018 ballot totals, precinct-level

```{r, echo=FALSE}

f("../cleaned_data/2012_2018_ballots_precinct.csv")

```


### 2018 Elections and Incumbent Commissioners, contest-level


```{r, echo=FALSE}

f("../cleaned_data/2018_ancElection_commissioners_contest.csv")

```

produced by merge_incumbents.R

The first part of this dataset is just from 2012_2018_ancElection_contest.csv, but years before 2018 are filtered out.

- commissioner_name -- name of commissioner who occupied the seat following the 2018 election
- match - do the name of election winner and commissioner match? (subsequence-based similarity over .5)
- vacant - seat is vacant following election
- switcharoo - seat is recorded occupied by a person other than election winner
- substantive_write_in - write-in winner becomes named commissioner
- absent - named election winner with seat subsequently recorded vacant
- empty - write-in winner; seat vacant
