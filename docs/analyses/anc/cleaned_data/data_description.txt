Terms:

Ward - division of the district, 1-8
ANC - Advisory Neighborhood Commission. Subdivision of ward identified by letter, e.g. 5D. Around 5-10 commissioners serve on an ANC.
SMD - "Single-member district"; subdivision of ANC from which a single ANC commissioner is elected



Quick summary:
election_history_R.csv is just the election datasets reformatted to proper scope
2018_elections_commissioners.csv is election_history_R.csv restricted to 2018 and merged with data on current commissioners
election_data_for_anc_map.csv is election_history_R collapsed to ANC-level with a handful of statistics for initial map visualization
anc_turnout.csv is ANC-level turnout estimated from precinct-level registrations and ballots based on geographic overlaps of precincts and ANCs; it's potentially noisy but seems like a good first pass.

current_anc_membership.csv is info Ilya scraped on current (mid 2019) ANC comms
anc_electoral_history_2012_2018.csv should be roughly equivalent to election_history_R.csv
